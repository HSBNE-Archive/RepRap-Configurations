RepRap Configurations
=====================

HSBNE Maintains a number of RepRaps, this repo allows versioning and tweaking of their configs.

Most machines have their own named branch; this contains the configuration files and slicing profiles that go in /home/pi/.octoprint on it's Raspberry Pi running an OctoPi image.

This master branch should contain slicing profiles for manually generating gcode, although it's strongly recommended to let OctoPrint do it for you.
